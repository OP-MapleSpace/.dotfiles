# Welcome to my NixOS config!

Here is my configuration for NixOS. It's still a work in progress but it's getting cooler by the day!

If you have any tips or questions please feel free to tell/ask me!

## Directories:
- flake-config: where the flake.nix lies
- user-config: for user-wide programs and configs; used by home-manager
- system-config: for system-wide programs and configs; usually used by nixos itself
- wallpaper: centralized place for all the configs to use a wallpaper
    
## To-Do (in no order)
- [ ] fix notifications
- [ ] configure ags
- [ ] configure rofi
- [ ] configure zathura
