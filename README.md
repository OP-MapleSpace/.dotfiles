# Welcome to MapleOS!

Here is my configuration for NixOS. It's still a work in progress but it's getting cooler by the day!

If you have any tips or questions please feel free to tell/ask me!

## Directories:
- flake-config: where the flake.nix lies
- user-config: for user-wide programs and configs; used by home-manager
- system-config: for system-wide programs and configs; usually used by nixos itself
- images: centralized place for all the configs to use images
- colorscheme: centralized place for all the configs to use a colorscheme
- python-env: custom python environments

## To-Do (in no order)
- [ ] configure zathura
- [ ] configure niri
- [ ] quickshell maybe?
